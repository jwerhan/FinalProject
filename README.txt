add a view all functionality

add the ability to filter

User Profile: Allow users to have a profile page where they can see their own reviews and maybe edit their personal information.

Book Details Page: Create a detailed page for each book with information like author, publication year, genre, etc. You could use an API like Google Books or Open Library to fetch this data.

Rating System: Implement a rating system for the books. Users could rate books on a scale of 1-5, and you could display the average rating on the book details page.

Comment System: Allow users to comment on reviews. This could encourage more user interaction and discussion about the books.
