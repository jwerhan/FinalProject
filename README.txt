add the ability to filter

User Profile: Allow users to have a profile page where they can see their own reviews and maybe edit their personal information.
- Favourite book / author / series / genre

Book Details Page: Create a detailed page for each book with information like author, publication year, genre, etc. You could use an API like Google Books or Open Library to fetch this data.

Rating System: Implement a rating system for the books. Users could rate books on a scale of 1-5, and you could display the average rating on the book details page.
