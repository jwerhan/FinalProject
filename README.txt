User Profile: Allow users to have a profile page where they can see their own reviews and maybe edit their personal information.

Recommendation System: Based on the books a user has reviewed or rated, suggest other books they might like.

Search by Genre/Author: Enhance the search functionality to allow users to search for books by genre or author, in addition to title.
